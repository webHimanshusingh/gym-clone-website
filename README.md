HTML Structure:<br>

DOCTYPE and Meta Tags: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5. Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document, such as character set and viewport settings.<br>
Header: Contains the site's title and navigation links.<br>
Hero Section: A prominent section with a background image, headline, and call-to-action button.<br>
Footer: Contains copyright information.<br>
CSS Styling:<br>

Reset Styles: Reset margins and paddings to avoid inconsistencies across browsers.<br>
Body: Sets the font family and text color.<br>
Container Class: Centralizes content and limits its width.<br>
Header and Navigation: Styles for the header background, text color, and navigation links.<br>
Hero Section: Uses a background image, centers the text, and styles the headline, paragraph, and button.<br>
Footer: Similar to the header in background color and text alignment.<br>
Additional Notes:<br>
Responsive Design: This example does not include responsive design features like media queries. For a fully responsive site, you would add CSS media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.<br>
Accessibility: Ensure proper accessibility by adding attributes like alt for images and using semantic HTML tags.<br>
SEO: Use proper heading levels and meta descriptions for better SEO.<br>
This is a basic example to get you started. You can expand it by adding more sections, improving styles, and making the layout responsive.<br>
